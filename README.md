  - **Edit Mode**:
    - The user can add a component to the user's web page, through a lateral menu that shows all the specific components             available for this theme. To include a component, the user has to add it using the + button. The component is included         in the last position.

  - **Preview Mode**:
    - It's used so that the user can view his page without distractions.
    - Hide the side menu so you can't add new components.
    - Block all editing functionality of a component (delete, edit, change position).    
    - Links work according to the attributes that we've given them in edit mode.
